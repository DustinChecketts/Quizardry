A simple trivia game built using ChatGPT, Google Sheets, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CodePen, EmailJS, GitHub, and WebIntoApp.

Includes a Home screen, Game screen, About screen, Score screen, as well as external links to a Google Form for user-submitted questions, an in-line form connected to an SMTP server to receive player feedback. 

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Used to identify simple games that could be created by a beginner developer. Conceptualized the minimum viable product (MVP) and stack.
- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aHAqn_szAF3kwQ9DrDupuCYGLYxEB2gsBCWoThk5dtk/edit?usp=sharing) - Acts as a read-only database for questions and answers, as well as a hopper for user-submitted questions.
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/StormtrooperTK421/pen/zYVLxJN) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) - My primary tool and scratch pad for bringing the project to life. Lots of back and forth with CodePen and ChatGPT.
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) - Free email service that connects to Gmail. Used to allow players to send feedback or request help.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - The framework I plan to refactor my code to following an initial release.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Version control as I refactor, iterate, and add features.
- [Tiiny.host](Tiiny.host) - Temporary host for testing/sharing.
- [WebIntoApp](https://www.webintoapp.com/) - How I port my web app into a packakge for release on other platforms.
